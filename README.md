# 📚 Course Task App

This project was a **task assignment**, and I treated it as an opportunity to apply **Clean Architecture** principles in a frontend context. Although it was a small task, I focused on code clarity, separation of concerns, and scalable structure to reflect real-world application architecture.

## 📁 Folder Structure

The project follows a **Clean Architecture** structure with clear separation between:

src/
- ├── application/
-  │└── hooks/
- ├── domain/
- |── models/
- ├── infrastructure/
-  │└── services/
- ├── presentation/
- ├── components/
- |── pages/
- ├── shared/
-  │├── components/
-  │└── utils/

This structure makes the codebase maintainable, testable

## 📌 Notes

This was a simple frontend task, but I approached it professionally by implementing Clean Architecture and focusing on scalability and clarity. The code is structured in a way that can easily grow into a full application.
